 <h1 style="color: hotpink;"> all about tokki</h1>


<p style="font-family: monospace;"> tokki is a maltipoo, with beige brown <strong> <em> hair.</em></strong>
maltipoos are different than other dogs because they are hypoallergenic, so they dont shed! <br>
That is why we say that maltipoos grow hair instead of fur, which sheds. <br>
tokki is a very special dog for a myriad of reasons: 
</p>

 <ol> 
    <li style="font-family: monospace;">she's small, her appetite is bigger than her body </li>
 <li style="font-family: monospace;"> she <em>loves</em> to use her voice and is not afraid to shout...</li>
<li style="font-family: monospace;"> she makes a sort of nasally gremlin growl sometimes and it's not determined if it's out of anger or fun..</li>
<li style="font-family: monospace;"> she can transform, making her a master of disguise</li>
</ol>
